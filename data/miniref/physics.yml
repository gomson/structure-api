    The study of the subatomic world, as described by vectors in Hilbert space.
    The big fuss about quantum mechanics is that, at very small scale, you simply
    can't know the exact position and velocity of all particles.
    The tools for doing physics with electron spins, atoms, and photons are
    mostly based on linear algebra and probability theory.
    If you want to analyze some real world systems (like the energy levels
    of the electron around the Hydrogen atom) then brace yourself for
    double integrals over spherical harmonics.
    I recommend you first learn matrix quantum mechanics and then move on to
    Schrodinger's equation, Hamiltonians and real-world physical systems.
